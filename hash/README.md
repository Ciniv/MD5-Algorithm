MD5 Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the MD5 hashing algorithm in Java.
MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that generates a 128-bit hash value from any input string. Although widely used for checksums and data integrity verification, MD5 is considered insecure for cryptographic purposes due to known vulnerabilities.
